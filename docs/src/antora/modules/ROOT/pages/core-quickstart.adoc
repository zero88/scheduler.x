= Scheduler.x Quickstart
:navtitle: Quickstart

`Scheduler.x` provides a builder pattern that allows you to create custom schedules for different business applications.

You can design a loop of recurrence from simple to complex in the `Trigger` object, step by step. After that, you can build a corresponding `Scheduler` object to manage the scheduling lifecycle, which contains a `Job` that performs your business operations.
