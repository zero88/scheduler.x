== From v1 to v2

This is a list of importance breaking-changes from `v1` to `v2`: https://github.com/zero88/schedulerx/issues?q=label%3Abreaking-changes+milestone%3A%22Version+2.0.0-rc1%22[breaking-changes]

In most case, the main API that means how to initialize `schedulerx` instance and how to execute SQL query via `schedulerx`, was not changed.
But, some importance changes in package/module level and project artifact name need to be updated by yourself:

. Update library dependency:
* Rename main artifact from `io.github.zero88:schedulerx-core` to `io.github.zero88:schedulerx`
* So you have to update the build descriptor. Follow xref:core-usage.adoc[]

. Change package name:
* Replace all `import` statement in java files from `import io.zero88.schedulerx` => `import io.github.zero88.schedulerx`
